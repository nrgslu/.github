# Networking Research Group (NRG) — Saint Louis University

Research lab at Saint Louis University led by **Dr. Flavio Esposito**, Associate Professor of Computer Science. We study **networked and cyber-physical systems** with a focus on **network virtualization and management**, **software-defined networking (SDN)**, **edge/cloud systems**, **wireless networks**, and **learning-driven networking**.

## What we work on
- **Programmable & virtualized networks:** SDN/NFV architectures, service/function chaining, intent-based management.
- **Edge & cyber-physical systems:** real-time orchestration at the edge; applications spanning medicine and precision agriculture.
- **Learning for networking:** reinforcement learning for congestion control and adaptive routing.
- **Privacy & security:** analyses of new protocols and secure AI for Open RANs.

## Recent highlights
- **Mutant** — an online RL congestion control that adapts to the best protocol behavior (NSDI 2025).
- **Oblivious DoH privacy analysis** — website-fingerprinting study (DSN 2025, Best Paper).
- Multiple NSF-funded efforts on resilient edge networking, knowledge-defined management, campus CI, Open RAN security, and CPS for smart farming.

## Open-source & software
- **Mutant (NSDI ’25):** online RL congestion control — code on GitHub.
- **Neighborhood Method (NM):** optimal virtual path embedding (SDN/NFV).
- **VINEA:** Virtual Network Embedding Architecture.
- **ProtoRINA:** prototype of the Recursive Internet Architecture.
- **Alloy models for Max-Consensus Auction (MCA).**
- **BUtorrent** (instrumented BitTorrent client); **PREDA** (predicate routing for DTN-over-MANET).
